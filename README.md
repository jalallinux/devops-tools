# Devops Tools

## What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations.
It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery
with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development;
several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology.

## What Are DevOps Tools?
DevOps works in the cross-functional mode, involving various tools of various kinds and
purposes, instead of just a single tool. These tools are also known as DevOps toolchains,
as discussed above.
The tools help throughout the software production lifecycle, including development,
management, and delivery.
The organization that uses DevOps practice coordinates these tools and fits each one of
them into one or more production activities like planning, creation, verification,
packaging, releasing, configuring, monitoring, and version control.
We have segmented various DevOps tools based on the production activities that they
can fit into.

including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix systems.
- You can set and configure Jenkins easily using its simple web interface with
built-in error checks and helps.
- Jenkins is super extensible through plugins, so you can perform a range of
additional functionalities.
- Since it’s extensible, Jenkins can easily be used as a CI/CD tool for any software
development project.
- As it’s a Java-based DevOps tool, you can easily distribute it across machines
to accelerate builds, tests, as well as deployments
